Capstone Project: Predictive Modelling for the likelihood of Diabetes
Project Introduction

The Diabetes Prediction Project leverages a comprehensive dataset containing both medical and demographic information from patients to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of diabetes. The dataset includes essential features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels. By analyzing these features, the project aims to create predictive models that can accurately identify patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes.

This project has significant implications for healthcare. Early and accurate identification of at-risk patients allows healthcare professionals to take proactive measures, offering timely intervention and personalized treatment plans. This approach can help prevent the onset of diabetes or manage its progression more effectively, improving patient outcomes and overall healthcare efficiency.

This project will help the healthcare expertise to address the growing challenge of diabetes, aiming to make a positive impact on public health.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset used for this project consists of 100,000 entries, with total of 9 columns which contain the following:

gender: The gender of the individual (e.g., Male, Female).
age: The age of the individual (in years).
hypertension: Indicator of hypertension (1 for yes, 0 for no).
heart_disease: Indicator of heart disease (1 for yes, 0 for no).
smoking_history: History of smoking (various status like 'never', 'current', etc.).
bmi: Body Mass Index (numeric value).
HbA1c_level: Level of HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin, numeric value).
blood_glucose_level: Blood glucose level (numeric value).
diabetes: Target variable indicating diabetes status (1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic).
To be able to achieve this, the following process will be followed:

1. Data Collection and Preparation: The first step to be taken is to import the dataset and libraries needed. followed by an initial inspection of data to understand the structure and characteristics of the data. Data cleaning will be conducted by handling missing values, converting variables to appropriate data types, and dropping irrelevant features if any.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I will explore the dataset to generate meaningful insights and uncover patterns in the data, utilizing visualizations to enhance understanding. This phase is crucial in revealing relationships between the features and the target variable (diabetes).

3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Data preprocessing steps will include encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling numerical features. Additionally, feature engineering techniques.

4. Model Development: The dataset will be split into training and test sets to develop and evaluate the model. Various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regressionand decision trees will be explored.

5. Model Evaluation and Interpretation: The model’s performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. Visual tools like confusion matrices and ROC curves will be generated to assess how well the model can predict the likelihood of diabetes.

6. Summary and Recommendations: Finally, the project will summarize key insights from the model evaluation. I will discuss insights drawn fom the result, model’s effectiveness, limitations, and potential areas for improvement.

By the end of this project, i will deliver a predictive model that can predict the likelihood of diabetes.
